Thus you must first do \"feature engineering\" before you can do segmentation. Don't worry, this problem is broken down into components.\n","\n","The dataset we use is [retail invoice](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1IUq9xm_0jWEs41iFp8TSWpb0CbPiT87m?usp=sharing) level data where 1 row = 1 SKU purchased on one occcasion. The data is organized into by Invoice X StockCode level. Each invoice is one purchase occassion, and for each invoice we have several observations representing the items purchased on that occassion.\n","\n","The goal of the first part is to create useful features about each consumer's observed behaviors, i.e. go from transaction level to customer level data. The goal of the second part is to then do segmentation based on these newly constructed features. "]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"25EWNNZV9Wxj"},"source":["# Part 1 Feature Engineering (5 points)\n","\n","Generally, feature engineering is where your marketing domain knowledge comes into play. In other words, your intuitions about what matters in terms of separating consumers into different groups should drive what features to engineer. However, in this assignment, you are expected to compute the following characteristics.\n","\n","## Read in data\n","Make the following selection of rows.\n","```\n","df = df[(df.CustomerID.notnull())&(df.Quantity>0)&(df.UnitPrice>0)&(df.StockCode.apply(lambda x: x[0] in '0123456789'))]\n","```\n","\n","1. What are the selection criteria based on the code above?\n","    **CustomerIDs that are not null, Quantities greater than zero, UnitPrices greater than zero, and StockCodes**\n","\n","## Unique count variables\n","\n","Create a dataframe, `df_u` that represents each consumer's total number of transactions and unique products purchased.\n","\n","Hint: use a `groupby` + `.nunique()` statement. `df.groupby('id')['x'].nunique().reset_index()` will find the number of unique values of column 'x' for each \"id\". You should calculate the number of unique `StockCode`'s (like SKU's) and `InvoicesNo`'s for each `CustomerID`. Change your column names in the resulting dataframe, `df_u`, to `['CustomerID', 'NTrans', 'NProducts']`.\n","\n","\n","## Customer spend\n","\n","Compute the total customer spending for each customer of this retailer. \n","\n","Hint\n","1. Create a column for `TotalSpend` (unit price x quantity)\n","1. Use a (groupby + sum) to create a dataframe `df_s` that contains each customer's sum of `TotalSpend`.\n","\n","## Compute price of average SKU purchased\n","\n","Create a dataframe `df_p` using groupby + mean combination to get average price of the items for each customer. Rename the columns `['CustomerID', 'AvgPrice']`.\n","\n","## Merge `df_u`, `df_s`, and `df_p` (2 merges), call new dataframe df_c (c for \"consumer\")\n","\n","Using the variables in `df_c`, compute the following additional columns:\n","1. Average spend per transaction (call it \"SpendPerTrans\")\n","1. Average SKUs per transaction (unique products/transaction, call it \"SKUsPerTrans\")\n","\n","\n","In total, you should have `df_c` with columns `['CustomerID', 'NTrans', 'NProducts', 'TotalSpend', 'AveragePrice', 'SpendPerTrans', 'SKUsPerTrans']`\n","\n","# Create standaradized version of df_c\n","\n","1. Create `df_c_std` that has all the columns of `df_c` except `CustomerID`.\n","1. Write a loop through all the columns of `df_c_std` to standardize each column (compute the z-score by subtracting mean and dividing by standard deviation).\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ZM6npcrmYLi9","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605657202996,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":714,"user":{"displayName":"Carly Bernhart","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgS8tdj9pUACvFgjg_-IRKz6hM88AIHo4aKSz0CCg=s64","userId":"09443077351150030604"}},"outputId":"ed5767a5-4728-4988-ac25-b2282ea2ac0e"},"source":["import os, pandas as pd, numpy as np, matplotlib.pyplot as plt\n","from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('drive')"],"execution_count":23,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"drive\", force_remount=True).\n"],"name":"stdout"}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"HiRlII9OYQgE","colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605657204931,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":689,"user":{"displayName":"Carly Bernhart","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgS8tdj9pUACvFgjg_-IRKz6hM88AIHo4aKSz0CCg=s64","userId":"09443077351150030604"}},"outputId":"7c8458cd-6843-45b2-8291-fab1adad59a2"},"source":["fpath = '/content/drive/MyDrive/MKTG 3509 - CUSTOMER DATA ANALYTICS/Assignment 9/'\n","os.listdir(fpath)"],"execution_count":24,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/plain":["['A9 + Carly Bernhart.ipynb', 'online_invoices.csv', 'online_invoices.gsheet']"]},"metadata":{"tags":[]},"execution_count":24}]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":195},"id":"RstnMwIK7O5Z","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1605657805027,"user_tz":300,"elapsed":1305,"user":{"displayName":"Carly Bernhart","photoUrl":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/a-/AOh14GgS8tdj9pUACvFgjg_-IRKz6hM88AIHo4aKSz0CCg=s64","userId":"09443077351150030604"}},"outputId":"bb047480-9f34-48c8-d361-0bd629fde1f6"},"source":["df = pd.read_csv(fpath + 'online_invoices.csv', sep = ',') #reading in the csv file\n","df.head()"],"execution_count":32,"outputs":[{"output_type":"execute_result","data":{"text/html":["<div>\n","<style scoped>\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","</style>\n","<table border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\">\n","  <thead>\n","    <tr style=\"text-align: right;\">\n","      <th></th>\n","      <th>InvoiceNo</th>\n","      <th>StockCode</th>\n","      <th>Description</th>\n","      <th>Quantity</th>\n","      <th>InvoiceDate</th>\n","      <th>UnitPrice</th>\n","      <th>CustomerID</th>\n","      <th>Country</th>\n","    </tr>\n","  </thead>\n","  <tbody>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>0</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>85123A</td>\n","      <td>WHITE HANGING HEART T-LIGHT HOLDER</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>2.55</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>1</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>71053</td>\n","      <td>WHITE METAL LANTERN</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>3.39</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>2</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>84406B</td>\n","      <td>CREAM CUPID HEARTS COAT HANGER</td>\n","      <td>8</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>2.75</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>3</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>84029G</td>\n","      <td>KNITTED UNION FLAG HOT WATER BOTTLE</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>3.39</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","    <tr>\n","      <th>4</th>\n","      <td>536365</td>\n","      <td>84029E</td>\n","      <td>RED WOOLLY HOTTIE WHITE HEART.</td>\n","      <td>6</td>\n","      <td>12/1/2010 8:26</td>\n","      <td>3.39</td>\n","      <td>17850.0</td>\n","      <td>United Kingdom</td>\n","    </tr>\n","  </tbody>\n","</table>\n","</div>"],"text/plain":["  InvoiceNo StockCode  ...
